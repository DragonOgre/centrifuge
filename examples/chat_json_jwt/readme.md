Example of server that accepts connections with JWT connection token - i.e. without authentication middleware that sets Credentials.

To start example locally install dependencies first:

```
dep init
dep ensure
```

Then go to http://localhost:8000 to see Websocket connection in action. You can also connect to this server with GRPC.
